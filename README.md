## Boids-3D

A rendering of the "boids" model by [Craig Reynolds](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) in 3D, with OpenGL. This version uses various OBJ models for types of fish and some rocks on the bottom of the "tank". The fish avoid hitting the top or bottom of the tank, and wrap around when hitting any of the sides. Fish follow their regular flocking rules for other fish of the same type, but only follow the "separation" rule with fish of other types. This creates some interesting behaviors, especially where the flocks collide.

## Particles-3D

A simple particle emitter, which emits textured cubes in 3D. An extension of the "particles" script detailed below.
